# Dictation audio fixture

`dictation_fixture.wav` is a short, deterministic fixture used by the CI end-to-end dictation integration test.

If you need to regenerate/replace it, keep it:
- WAV, mono, 16kHz, 16-bit PCM
- ~2–4 seconds
- phrase similar to: “hello fluid voice”

Note: ensure you have appropriate rights to redistribute any replacement audio.
